# calicensus

A data science toolkit for exploring California Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data.

This project provides code, documentation, and workflows for cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing California's publicly available census data. While initial efforts focus on **housing affordability**, the broader aim is to support equity-centered analysis across a range of socioeconomic indicators, including **income**, **education**, **race**, **disability**, and **employment**.

## üåü Goals

- Develop reusable scripts for data acquisition and wrangling (ACS, SAIPE, IRS, Gini Index, etc.)
- Create a flexible, modular structure for exploratory and statistical analysis
- Enable visual storytelling using ggplot2, sf, and other R tools
- Support reproducible, equity-informed insights into structural disparities in California
